# Bayesian

I'll soon upload notebooks for Regression, Logistic Regression, Poisson Regression, ANOVA, Hierarchical Modeling, Misture Models and one real life event's Probabilistic Modelling, once my exam gets over. [Done]

For the next task, I'm following two books:
* Bayesian Data Analysis by Andrew Gelaman
* Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath
